# levenshtein

An implementation of Levenshtein distance in Python.

As a lover of words, I appreciate string distance metrics. "Those two words have a low Levenshtein distance" is a phrase I have used more than once. But, I had never implemented one. When I looked into Levenshtein distance, I saw matrices and words. I was somewhat confused and intimidated, but part of me wanted to face the challenge to implement the algorithm. With help from [Wikipedia's pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance#Iterative_with_full_matrix), I implemented Levenshtein distance in Python.

Levenshtein distance lets you measure the difference between two strings of equal or different lengths. Levenshtein distance measures insertions, deletions, and amendments. The Levenshtein distance is equal to the number of one-character changes you would need to make to turn one string into another.
